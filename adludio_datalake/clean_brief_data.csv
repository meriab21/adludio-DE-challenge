 - Client Feedback from RFP:
  - As much as I love the concept, I’m not 100% sold on the creative/imagery. And that has less to do with your team and more to do with the limited files we had. BUT we just received more files that could allow for more creative flexibility: See asset link above
  - You’ll find PSD files and images that can be used to create a 360. Can you have your creative take a look and see if they can come up with other creative versions? As a reminder, we’ll want to focus on RMAX2 and RMAX4 and LE (Limited Edition) models. For the PSD files, we would love to incorporate the split lifestyle/terrain theme. As for the 360, the client loves anytime that can be featured –maybe in the part where they choose between the 2 and 4 seater? I know it requires more work in the backend so I’ll defer to you and your team on the feasibility of making that happen
 - New creative mocks due 9/25. Let's keep them storyboards for now until client is aligned on the concepts.","Brand Awareness

Discussion Recap : 
Exact wording: 

1) Actually we changed our mind a little on the background colour scheme. Can you go with background colours as in the attached PNG. Call to action button colour will have to change to another colour I think otherwise there's too much purple colour.
Sure. Let me check with the design team on the colour arrangement. Will share you reference with the team 

2) The overall design of the bull is great. But can it be a bit ""fatter"" so to speak? Currently it looks a bit skinny. A slightly fatter bull signififies wealth, propserity and also reminds people of the bull from a bull market in stock trading.
Let me check with the design team to see if there is another similar bull image but looking fatter

Storyboard Stage : 
I have attached both storyboard that were shared with the Lazada team in Singapore. These were created with the final campaign assets.

Discussion Recap : 
The client has provided feedback on storyboards, please see below:

As for the concepts, 'Press' concept is more or less good to go, please see our comments attached.

As for the 'scrub' concept, as we just confirmed a car as part of our 12.12 rewards, would like to use that instead of Lee Min Ho. 
So we will omit the TVC for this concept. How I envision the storyboard: 

Frame 1: Open up with our SKU KV to say something along the line of 'BE REWARDED WITH EVERYTHING YOU LOVE'. Scrub to find out more! 

Frame 2: It reveals KV of the car. Please get image here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P8FqUV2v8tnGHNbIjIuIBz0LKTJfnQHF?usp=sharing
Are we able to have CTA text appear a little later that says 'Scrub to see more rewards when you shop on 12.12' 
Frame 3: It will reveal more rewards (attached are the logos/product images of the rewards we are giving away) - every consumer is entitled to 2 free gifts when they shop with us (no min. spend required). 
1/ a voucher for a snack (drink/cookie)
2/ a 5% return voucher

We must suggest an interaction (press and hold or scrub) that let the user believe he/she sprayed the words her/himslef.

Assets inclide the raw formats, let us know if PSD are needed.

We liaise with teh creative agency DDDB for anything realted to assets.

The campaign lasts until the end of the year. There are 8 different creatives. We need to focus on 2 creatives per months.
